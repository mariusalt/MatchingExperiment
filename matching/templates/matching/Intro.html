	<p><b>Roles</b><br>
	You have been matched with another participant. One of you will take on the role of Player A, while the other one will be Player B. Whether you take part as Player A or Player B is randomly determined by the computer. <b>While Player A starts with an endowment of 10 Tokens, Player B is endowed with 5 Tokens </b>
	</p><p>&nbsp;</p>


	<p><b>Rounds</b><br>
	First round Fischbacher. Second round PGG with Subsidy option<p>
	
	<p>
	{% if player.id_in_group == 1 %}
		In this game you are <b>PlayerA</b> and you are endowed with <b>10</b> Tokens.
	{% else %}
		In this game you are <b>PlayerB</b> and you are endowed with <b>5</b> Tokens.
	{% endif %}
	</p>

	<p>
	In the second round, {% if player.id_in_group == 1 %} you will have the chance to subsidize the other player{% else %} the other player will tell you by how much he/she wants to subsidize your contribution to a common project{% endif %}. This will be fun!
